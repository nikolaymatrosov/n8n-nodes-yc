# Workspace Rules

## Critical Global Rules
- NEVER try to edit svg files. I'll do it myself.
- **Always work from within the package directory** when running tests
- **Mock all external dependencies** in unit tests
- **Confirm test cases with user** before writing unit tests
- **Typecheck is critical before committing** - always run `pnpm typecheck`
- **When modifying pinia stores**, check for unused computed properties

## Commit Messages
All commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification.
See `.cursor/rules/commit-message-format.mdc` for detailed guidelines.

## Testing
What we use for testing and writing tests:
- For testing nodes and other backend components, we use Jest for unit tests. Examples can be found in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/**/*test*`.
- We use `nock` for server mocking
- For frontend we use `vitest`
- For e2e tests we use `Playwright` and `pnpm dev:e2e`. The old Cypress tests
  are being migrated to Playwright, so please use Playwright for new tests.

See `.cursor/rules/testing-guidelines.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/test-approach.mdc` for detailed testing guidelines.
